#`binary-serializer`

Serializing counterpart of [keichi/binary-parser](https://github.com/keichi/binary-parser).

*Still a work-in-progress. Currently, all test cases of the original module pass in the opposite direction (yay!)*

__Note:__ Due to undefined behavior, `.skip` is and will not be supported.
